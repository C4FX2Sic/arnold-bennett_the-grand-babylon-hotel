			</h2>
			<p>“There is one thing, Prince, that we have just got to settle straight off,” said Theodore Racksole.</p>
			<p>They were all three seated⁠—Racksole, his daughter, and Prince Aribert⁠—round a dinner table in a private room at the Hôtel Wellington. Racksole had duly arrived by the afternoon boat, and had been met on the quay by the other two. They had dined early, and Racksole had heard the full story of the adventures by sea and land of Nella and the Prince. As to his own adventure of the previous night he said very little, merely explaining, with as little detail as possible, that Dimmock’s body had come to light.</p>
			<p>“What is that?” asked the Prince, in answer to Racksole’s remark.</p>
			<p>“We have got to settle whether we shall tell the police at once all that has occurred, or whether we shall proceed on our own responsibility. There can be no doubt as to which course we ought to pursue. Every consideration of prudence points to the advisability of taking the police into our confidence, and leaving the matter entirely in their hands.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, Papa!” Nella burst out in her pouting, impulsive way. “You surely can’t think of such a thing. Why, the fun has only just begun.”</p>
			<p>“Do you call last night fun?” questioned Racksole, gazing at her solemnly.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I do,” she said promptly. “Now.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I don’t,” was the millionaire’s laconic response; but perhaps he was thinking of his own situation in the lift.</p>
			<p>“Do you not think we might investigate a little further,” said the Prince judiciously, as he cracked a walnut, “just a little further⁠—and then, if we fail to accomplish anything, there would still be ample opportunity to consult the police?”</p>
			<p>“How do you suggest we should begin?” asked Racksole.</p>
			<p>“Well, there is the house which Miss Racksole so intrepidly entered last evening”⁠—he gave her the homage of an admiring glance; “you and I, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Racksole, might examine that abode in detail.”</p>
			<p>“Tonight?”</p>
			<p>“Certainly. We might do something.”</p>
			<p>“We might do too much.”</p>
			<p>“For example?”</p>
			<p>“We might shoot someone, or get ourselves mistaken for burglars. If we outstepped the law, it would be no excuse for us that we had been acting in a good cause.”</p>
			<p>“True,” said the Prince. “Nevertheless⁠—” He stopped.</p>
			<p>“Nevertheless you have a distaste for bringing the police into the business. You want the hunt all to yourself. You are on fire with the ardour of the chase. Is not that it? Accept the advice of an older man, Prince, and sleep on this affair. I have little fancy for nocturnal escapades two nights together. As for you, Nella, off with you to bed. The Prince and I will have a yarn over such fluids as can be obtained in this hole.”</p>
			<p>“Papa,” she said, “you are perfectly horrid tonight.”</p>
			<p>“Perhaps I am,” he said. “Decidedly I am very cross with you for coming over here all alone. It was monstrous. If I didn’t happen to be the most foolish of parents⁠—There! Good night. It’s nine o’clock. The Prince, I am sure, will excuse you.”</p>
			<p>If Nella had not really been very tired Prince Aribert might have been the witness of a good-natured but stubborn conflict between the millionaire and his spirited offspring. As it was, Nella departed with surprising docility, and the two men were left alone.</p>
			<p>“Now,” said Racksole suddenly, changing his tone, “I fancy that after all I’m your man for a little amateur investigation tonight. And, if I must speak the exact truth, I think that to sleep on this affair would be about the very worst thing we could do. But I was anxious to keep Nella out of harm’s way at any rate till tomorrow. She is a very difficult creature to manage, Prince, and I may warn you,” he laughed grimly, “that if we do succeed in doing anything tonight we shall catch it from her ladyship in the morning. Are you ready to take that risk?”</p>
			<p>“I am,” the Prince smiled. “But Miss Racksole is a young lady of quite remarkable nerve.”</p>
			<p>“She is,” said Racksole drily. “I wish sometimes she had less.”</p>
			<p>“I have the highest admiration for Miss Racksole,” said the Prince, and he looked Miss Racksole’s father full in the face.</p>
			<p>“You honour us, Prince,” Racksole observed. “Let us come to business. Am I right in assuming that you have a reason for keeping the police out of this business, if it can possibly be done?”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said the Prince, and his brow clouded. “I am very much afraid that my poor nephew has involved himself in some scrape that he would wish not to be divulged.”</p>
			<p>“Then you do not believe that he is the victim of foul play?”</p>
			<p>“I do not.”</p>
			<p>“And the reason, if I may ask it?”</p>
			<p>“<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Racksole, we speak in confidence⁠—is it not so? Some years ago my foolish nephew had an affair⁠—an affair with a feminine star of the Berlin stage. For anything I know, the lady may have been the very pattern of her sex, but where a reigning Prince is concerned scandal cannot be avoided in such a matter. I had thought that the affair was quite at an end, since my nephew’s betrothal to Princess Anna of Eckstein-Schwartzburg is shortly to be announced. But yesterday I saw the lady to whom I have referred driving on the Digue. The coincidence of her presence here with my nephew’s disappearance is too extraordinary to be disregarded.”</p>
			<p>“But how does this theory square with the murder of Reginald Dimmock?”</p>
			<p>“It does not square with it. My idea is that the murder of poor Dimmock and the disappearance of my nephew are entirely unconnected⁠—unless, indeed, this Berlin actress is playing into the hands of the murderers. I had not thought of that.”</p>
			<p>“Then what do you propose to do tonight?”</p>
			<p>“I propose to enter the house which Miss Racksole entered last night and to find out something definite.”</p>
			<p>“I concur,” said Racksole. “I shall heartily enjoy it. But let me tell you, Prince, and pardon me for speaking bluntly, your surmise is incorrect. I would wager a hundred thousand dollars that Prince Eugen has been kidnapped.”</p>
			<p>“What grounds have you for being so sure?”</p>
			<p>“Ah!” said Racksole, “that is a long story. Let me begin by asking you this. Are you aware that your nephew, Prince Eugen, owes a million of money?”</p>
			<p>“A million of money!” cried Prince Aribert astonished. “It is impossible!”</p>
			<p>“Nevertheless, he does,” said Racksole calmly. Then he told him all he had learnt from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Sampson Levi.</p>
			<p>“What have you to say to that?” Racksole ended. Prince Aribert made no reply.</p>
			<p>“What have you to say to that?” Racksole insisted.</p>
			<p>“Merely that Eugen is ruined, even if he is alive.”</p>
			<p>“Not at all,” Racksole returned with cheerfulness. “Not at all. We shall see about that. The special thing that I want to know just now from you is this: Has any previous application ever been made for the hand of the Princess Anna?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. Last year. The King of Bosnia sued for it, but his proposal was declined.”</p>
			<p>“Why?”</p>
			<p>“Because my nephew was considered to be a more suitable match for her.”</p>
			<p>“Not because the personal character of his Majesty of Bosnia is scarcely of the brightest?”</p>
			<p>“No. Unfortunately it is usually impossible to consider questions of personal character when a royal match is concerned.”</p>
			<p>“Then, if for any reason the marriage of Princess Anna with your nephew was frustrated, the King of Bosnia would have a fair chance in that quarter?”</p>
			<p>“He would. The political aspect of things would be perfectly satisfactory.”</p>
			<p>“Thanks!” said Racksole. “I will wager another hundred thousand dollars that someone in Bosnia⁠—I don’t accuse the King himself⁠—is at the bottom of this business. The methods of Balkan politicians have always been half-Oriental. Let us go.”</p>
			<p>“Where?”</p>
			<p>“To this precious house of Nella’s adventure.”</p>
			<p>“But surely it is too early?”</p>
			<p>“So it is,” said Racksole, “and we shall want a few things, too. For instance, a dark lantern. I think I will go out and forage for a lantern.”</p>
			<p>“And a revolver?” suggested Prince Aribert.</p>
			<p>“Does it mean revolvers?”</p>
			<p>The millionaire laughed.</p>
			<p>“It may come to that.”</p>
			<p>“Here you are, then, my friend,” said Racksole, and he pulled one out of his hip pocket. “And yours?”</p>
			<p>“I,” said the Prince, “I have your daughter’s.”</p>
			<p>“The deuce you have!” murmured Racksole to himself.</p>
			<p>It was then half past nine. They decided that it would be impolitic to begin their operations till after midnight. There were three hours to spare.</p>
			<p>“Let us go and see the gambling,” Racksole suggested. “We might encounter the Berlin lady.” The suggestion, in the first instance, was not made seriously, but it appeared to both men that they might do worse than spend the intervening time in the gorgeous saloon of the Kursaal, where, in the season, as much money is won and lost as at Monte Carlo. It was striking ten o’clock as they entered the rooms. There was a large company present⁠—a company which included some of the most notorious persons in Europe. In that multifarious assemblage all were equal. The electric light shone coldly and impartially on the just and on the unjust, on the fool and the knave, on the European and the Asiatic. As usual, women monopolized the best places at the tables.</p>
			<p>The scene was familiar enough to Prince Aribert, who had witnessed it frequently at Monaco, but Theodore Racksole had never before entered any European gaming palace; he had only the haziest idea of the rules of play, and he was at once interested. For some time they watched the play at the table which happened to be nearest to them. Racksole never moved his lips.</p>
			<p>With his eyes glued on the table, and ears open for every remark, of the players and the croupier, he took his first lesson in roulette. He saw a mere youth win fifteen thousand francs, which were stolen in the most barefaced manner by a rouged girl scarcely older than the youth; he saw two old gamesters stake their coins, and lose, and walk quietly out of the place; he saw the bank win fifty thousand francs at a single turn.</p>
			<p>“This is rather good fun,” he said at length, “but the stakes are too small to make it really exciting. I’ll try my luck, just for the experience. I’m bound to win.”</p>
			<p>“Why?” asked the Prince.</p>
			<p>“Because I always do, in games of chance,” Racksole answered with gay confidence. “It is my fate. Then tonight, you must remember, I shall be a beginner, and you know the tyro’s luck.”</p>
			<p>In ten minutes the croupier of that table was obliged to suspend operations pending the arrival of a further supply of coin.</p>
			<p>“What did I tell you?” said Racksole, leading the way to another table further up the room. A hundred curious glances went after him. One old woman, whose gay attire suggested a false youthfulness, begged him in French to stake a five-franc piece for her. She offered him the coin. He took it, and gave her a hundred-franc note in exchange. She clutched the crisp rustling paper, and with hysterical haste scuttled back to her own table.</p>
			<p>At the second table there was a considerable air of excitement. In the forefront of the players was a woman in a low-cut evening dress of black silk and a large red picture hat. Her age appeared to be about twenty-eight; she had dark eyes, full lips, and a distinctly Jewish nose. She was handsome, but her beauty was of that forbidding, sinister order which is often called Junoesque. This woman was the centre of attraction. People said to each other that she had won a hundred and sixty thousand francs that day at the table.</p>
			<p>“You were right,” Prince Aribert whispered to Theodore Racksole; “that is the Berlin lady.”</p>
			<p>“The deuce she is! Has she seen you? Will she know you?”</p>
			<p>“She would probably know me, but she hasn’t looked up yet.”</p>
			<p>“Keep behind her, then. I propose to find her a little occupation.” By dint of a carefully-exercised diplomacy, Racksole manoeuvred himself into a seat opposite to the lady in the red hat. The fame of his success at the other table had followed him, and people regarded him as a serious and formidable player. In the first turn the lady put a thousand francs on double zero; Racksole put a hundred on number nineteen and a thousand on the odd numbers.</p>
			<p>Nineteen won. Racksole received four thousand four hundred francs. Nine times in succession Racksole backed number nineteen and the odd numbers; nine times the lady backed double zero. Nine times Racksole won and the lady lost. The other players, perceiving that the affair had resolved itself into a duel, stood back for the most part and watched those two. Prince Aribert never stirred from his position behind the great red hat. The game continued. Racksole lost trifles from time to time, but ninety-nine hundredths of the luck was with him. As an English spectator at the table remarked, “he couldn’t do wrong.” When midnight struck the lady in the red hat was reduced to a thousand francs. Then she fell into a winning vein for half an hour, but at one o’clock her resources were exhausted. Of the hundred and sixty thousand francs which she was reputed to have had early in the evening, Racksole held about ninety thousand, and the bank had the rest.</p>
			<p>It was a calamity for the Juno of the red hat. She jumped up, stamped her foot, and hurried from the room. At a discreet distance Racksole and the Prince pursued her.</p>
			<p>“It might be well to ascertain her movements,” said Racksole.</p>
			<p>Outside, in the glare of the great arc lights, and within sound of the surf which beats always at the very foot of the Kursaal, the Juno of the red hat summoned a fiacre and drove rapidly away. Racksole and the Prince took an open carriage and started in pursuit. They had not, however, travelled more than half a mile when Prince Aribert stopped the carriage, and, bidding Racksole get out, paid the driver and dismissed him.</p>
			<p>“I feel sure I know where she is going,” he explained, “and it will be better for us to follow on foot.”</p>
			<p>“You mean she is making for the scene of last night’s affair?” said Racksole.</p>
			<p>“Exactly. We shall⁠—what you call, kill two birds with one stone.”</p>
			<p>Prince Aribert’s guess was correct. The lady’s carriage stopped in front of the house where Nella Racksole and Miss Spencer had had their interview on the previous evening, and the lady vanished into the building just as the two men appeared at the end of the street. Instead of proceeding along that street, the Prince led Racksole to the lane which gave on to the backs of the houses, and he counted the houses as they went up the lane. In a few minutes they had burglariously climbed over a wall, and crept, with infinite caution, up a long, narrow piece of ground⁠—half garden, half paved yard, till they crouched under a window⁠—a window which was shielded by curtains, but which had been left open a little.</p>
			<p>“Listen,” said the Prince in his lightest whisper, “they are talking.”</p>
			<p>“Who?”</p>
			<p>“The Berlin lady and Miss Spencer. I’m sure it’s Miss Spencer’s voice.”</p>
			<p>Racksole boldly pushed the french window a little wider open, and put his ear to the aperture, through which came a beam of yellow light.</p>
			<p>“Take my place,” he whispered to the Prince, “they’re talking German. You’ll understand better.”</p>
			<p>Silently they exchanged places under the window, and the Prince listened intently.</p>
			<p>“Then you refuse?” Miss Spencer’s visitor was saying.</p>
			<p>There was no answer from Miss Spencer.</p>
			<p>“Not even a thousand francs? I tell you I’ve lost the whole twenty-five thousand.”</p>
			<p>Again no answer.</p>
			<p>“Then I’ll tell the whole story,” the lady went on, in an angry rush of words. “I did what I promised to do. I enticed him here, and you’ve got him safe in your vile cellar, poor little man, and you won’t give me a paltry thousand francs.”</p>
			<p>“You have already had your price.” The words were Miss Spencer’s. They fell cold and calm on the night air.</p>
			<p>“I want another thousand.”</p>
			<p>“I haven’t it.”</p>
			<p>“Then we’ll see.”</p>
			<p>Prince Aribert heard a rustle of flying skirts; then another movement⁠—a door banged, and the beam of light through the aperture of the window suddenly disappeared. He pushed the window wide open. The room was in darkness, and apparently empty.</p>
			<p>“Now for that lantern of yours,” he said eagerly to Theodore Racksole, after he had translated to him the conversation of the two women, Racksole produced the dark lantern from the capacious pocket of his dust coat, and lighted it. The ray flashed about the ground.</p>
			<p>“What is it?” exclaimed Prince Aribert with a swift cry, pointing to the ground. The lantern threw its light on a perpendicular grating at their feet, through which could be discerned a cellar. They both knelt down, and peered into the subterranean chamber. On a broken chair a young man sat listlessly with closed eyes, his head leaning heavily forward on his chest.</p>
			<p>In the feeble light of the lantern he had the livid and ghastly appearance of a corpse.</p>
			<p>“Who can it be?” said Racksole.</p>
			<p>“It is Eugen,” was the Prince’s low answer.</p>
